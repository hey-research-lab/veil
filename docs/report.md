## 1. Project Description

**Veil** is a non-custodial zero-knowledge privacy layer for Uniswap v4, deployed natively on **Robinhood Chain (EVM mainnet 4663)**. It lets users shield funds into fixed-denomination (`0.001`) privacy notes, swap while shielded through an atomic relay → swap → re-shield flow, and withdraw to fresh decoupled addresses — with Groth16 ZK-SNARK proofs verified onchain for every exit.

Two rails share one protocol:

1. **Privacy rail (Shield → Swap → Withdraw):**
   Fixed `0.001` ETH/VEIL notes in audited 0xbow v1.2.1 privacy pools. The `VeilZkRouter` executes atomic single-note, multi-note (max 8), and direct-payout flows: relay exit chains fund-to-fund into an exact-input v4 swap, the output funds a fresh note (or pays out visibly, honestly labeled). Router invariant-0: it never retains a wei. Self-relay is the supported path through F5 — no hosted relayer, no custody, no fallback needed.
2. **Flywheel rail (Attest → Gated Swap → Burn):**
   Permissionless self-attestation unlocks the ZK-gated v4 pool (30-day launch window). Every gated swap pays a 30 bps hook fee into `VeilTreasury`; 70% is bought back and burned via `burn()` (supply shrinks, never dead-address theater).

All contracts are live on mainnet 4663, Sourcify-verified 10/10, with Uniswap v4 integration on the canonical PoolManager.

## 2. Core Value Proposition & Problem Solved

### The Problem

- **Naked AMM trails:** every Uniswap swap permanently links wallet → amount → counterparty on a public explorer.
- **Mixer stigma & risk:** legacy mixers are custodial, freezable, and legally toxic.
- **Fee waste:** standard AMM fees enrich passive LPs instead of reinforcing the protocol users chose.
- **Bot-infested launches:** snipers eat retail fills in the first blocks of every pool.

### The Veil Solution

- **Fixed-denomination unlinkability:**
  Every note is exactly `0.001` — uniform notes are unfingerprintable. Rigidity is the privacy source.
- **Atomic full-ZK swap (`VeilZkRouter`):**
  Relay → swap → re-shield in ONE transaction (transient stage guard + invariant-0 + events). Any leg failing reverts everything; dust above note value refunds instantly; below-denomination outputs settle visibly (labeled, never stranded).
- **Withdrawals that cannot be blocked:**
  No pause switch, no guardian, no allowlist on any withdraw path — by code, proven live.
- **Autonomous 30/70 flywheel (`VeilHook` → `VeilTreasury`):**
  30 bps per gated swap → treasury → 70% `burn()` + 30% ops. Burns proven onchain with `TokensBurned` events.
- **Gated launch windows:**
  Open self-attestation (EIP-191, no eligibility, no owner) unlocks the gated pool during its window — anti-bot speedbump without permission.

## 4. Key Architectural Components

### A. Smart Contracts (`contracts/`)

- **`VeilZkRouter.sol` (`0x0fb4…9b4c`):**
  Atomic relay → swap → deposit/direct executor. Single, multi (max 8), direct-payout entries. Transient `_stage` machine + `nonReentrant` + invariant-0 on every exit. Proof verification delegated to the audited 0xbow Entrypoint (B1: atomicity, not re-checks).
- **`VeilHook.sol` (`0xf95f…20c4`, CREATE2 salt `…4b7d`, flags `0x20C4`):**
  `beforeInitialize | beforeSwap | afterSwap | afterSwapReturnDelta`. ZK-gated launch windows (attestation + EIP-191 signature check) + 30 bps fee via `poolManager.take()` to treasury.
- **`VeilAttestationRegistry.sol` (`0xd1f1…8add1d`):**
  Permissionless `selfAttest` (EIP-191 nonce + deadline, no owner, no attester). Owner keeps indefinite control (no renounce schedule).
- **`VeilTreasury.sol` (`0xb68c…8152`):**
  Fee accumulator. Permissionless `executeBurn` (capped at balance), owner-only `rescue`, `buybackShareBps = 7000`, `setVeilToken` for the canonical Pons token.
- **`VeilShieldRouter.sol` (`0x3db4…22a55c`):**
  Legacy 1-tx Swap-to-Shield + ShieldedSwap with the R1 `PoolManager.settle{value}` fix. Provisional paths exit-only.
- **`MainnetLiquidityHelper.sol` (`0xb419…2e9b0b`) / `MainnetSwapHelper.sol` (`0x08b1…19a58`):**
  Recoverable v4 seeding (unlock-routed removal) + exact-input gated swaps. No PositionManager needed.
- **0xbow core (vendored, audited v1.2.1, never modified):**
  `Entrypoint` (UUPS proxy `0x96cb…50b1`), ETH pool `0x10c1…1932`, VEIL pool `0xdb9f…90d1` (both fixed `0.001`), Groth16 verifiers, Poseidon, LeanIMT.

### B. Frontend (`app/`, `components/`)

- Trade terminal with guided 1-2-3-4 journey, chain-aware copy (no testnet leakage on mainnet), per-tab fail-closed guards, backup-gated withdrawals, live telemetry + Merkle root, Merkle/ASP freshness gates before every send.
- `/burn` (live `totalBurned` + event ledger), `/contracts` (live registry + Sourcify/Blockscout honesty note), `/status` (pool health), `/docs/*`, `/privacy`, `/terms` live.

## 7. Security, Trust & Risk Controls

1. **Non-Custodial Architecture:**
   App and servers never hold private keys or escrow funds. Notes live only in the browser vault (PBKDF2-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM); every transaction is signed in the user's wallet.
2. **Invariant-0 + Atomicity:**
   Every router exit asserts zero retained balance; relay → swap → deposit runs in one transaction or reverts entirely (proven live, zero residue repeatedly).
3. **Unblockable Withdrawals:**
   No pause switch, no guardian, no allowlist on any withdraw path — by code, proven live (ETH notes ×3, VEIL notes ×1, fresh recipients).
4. **Fail-Closed UI:**
   Chain gates, denomination gates, allowance gates, ASP/state freshness gates, spent pre-checks, exact-calldata pre-send simulations. No quote = no execution button.
5. **Audited-Circuit Reuse Only:**
   Full-ZK exclusively on audited 0xbow v1.2.1 circuits — no novel crypto, no new ceremony. External audit permanently waived by owner decision with residual accepted; internal audit PASS WITH CONDITIONS.
6. **Verified Sources:**
   Sourcify 10/10 on chain 4663. Blockscout checkmarks follow their verifier's solc 0.8.37 support (honestly disclosed on /contracts).
7. **Open Association Sets:**
   Every label ever deposited plus genesis sentinel, published mechanically, no human allow/deny. Policy public at /docs/asp-policy.
